Project Manual
Before running the code, please ensure the following steps are completed:

1. Preparing the Dataset
Ensure you have downloaded the Apple.csv dataset.
Place the Apple.csv file in the same directory as the notebook files. This is crucial for the code to access and process the data correctly.

-->Files to Run
   You will be working with two Jupyter Notebook files:

   Fuzzy_time_series_fin.ipynb
   Stock_arima_sarima_lstm.ipynb

-->Environment Setup
   Run the notebook files in Jupyter Notebooks or Google Colab to view the results. Make sure that all required libraries are already installed.

Executing the Notebooks
Open your preferred platform (Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab):

-If using Jupyter Notebook, navigate to the folder containing your notebooks and dataset.
-If using Google Colab, upload the notebooks and the Apple.csv file to your session.
